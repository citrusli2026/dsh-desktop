# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`docs/decisions/`**: this repo's ADR-style decision records, governed by
  `docs/decisions/README.md`. Read the ones that touch the area you're about
  to work in (they are numbered `00NN-*.md`).

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md                      ← glossary (created lazily)
├── docs/decisions/                 ← ADR-style decision records
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── 0001-*.md
│   └── ...
├── docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing decision record, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts 00NN (…), but worth reopening because…_
